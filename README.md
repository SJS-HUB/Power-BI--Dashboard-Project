# Power BI: Dashboard Project
 Comprehensive Space Mission Analysis: Filtered, transformed, and edited data using Power Query Editor in Power BI. Developed an interactive and visually compelling dashboard showcasing mission statuses, company performance, and rocket activity trends over time


# üöÄ Space Mission Analysis Dashboard

## üåå Project Overview
Unveil the history of space exploration with this **interactive Power BI dashboard**! Analyzing over 4,600 space missions from 1957 to 2022, this dashboard offers insights into mission outcomes, rocket statuses, company contributions, and geographical trends. Designed to be a tool for exploring patterns in the space industry, this project demonstrates the power of **data visualization** and **analytics**.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Mission Status Analysis**: Filter through success, partial failure, prelaunch failure, and full failure outcomes.
- **Rocket Insights**: Breakdown of active vs. retired rockets across various companies.
- **Time Trends**: Count of rocket launches visualized by year to observe patterns in space missions.
- **Company Contributions**: Compare mission counts by companies like SpaceX, RVSN USSR, and CASC.
- **Interactive World Map**: Explore geographical trends in rocket launches using map visualizations.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Techniques
1. **Power Query Editor**: Cleaned and transformed raw space mission data for analysis.
2. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Created custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analytics.
3. **Power BI**: Designed an engaging and dynamic dashboard for storytelling through data.
4. **Data Sources**: Historical space mission data.

## üìä Dashboard Highlights
- The **Count of Rockets by Year** reveals the boom in space exploration activities post-2000.
- **Rocket Status Breakdown** showcases 78% active rockets, highlighting current industry momentum.
- A **global map** visualizes the spatial distribution of space missions across continents.

## üß† Learning Outcome
- Mastered the use of **DAX** for creating calculated measures like mission success rates and active rocket proportions.
- Improved data insights through interactive dashboard for data visualization in Power BI.
- Enhanced proficiency in data transformation and filtering with Power Query Editor.
